  <p>A Pupusa is a delicious thick corn masa Flatbread filled cheese, beans, meat. It hails from El Salvador and is their national Dish. A Pupusa is also accompanied by curtido (cabbage slaw), and tomato salsa(not spicy)

  <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>1 pound of bacon</li>
      <li>3 tomatoes</li>
      <li>1 cup of monterey jack or mozzeralla cheese</li>
      <li>1 green pepper</li>
      <li>2 cloves of garlic (optional)</li>
      <li>Salt to taste</1i>
      <li>4 cups of masa harina</li>
      <li>2 cups of water</li>
      <li>1/2 cup of vegetable oil</li>
      <li>skillet</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Step by Step guide</h1>

      <ol>
        <li>Place bacon in a large pan and cook over a medium-high heat, turn the bacon occasionally, until its almost cooked but not crispy yet, 5/6 minutes. Put the bacon and the grease(optional but amazing) into a blender or food processor. Add tomatoes (halved), quartered green bell pepper, cheese, and minced garlic. Puree and season it with salt. Bam!! you got chicharron which is what we are putting in the tortilla.  </li>
        <li>Mix Masa Harina and 1/2 cup water together in a bowl by hand. Add the remaining water slowly, about 2 tablespoons at a time, mixing well after each addition, until dough is moist but still firm. Cover with a wet towel.</li>
        <li>Heat 1/2 up oil in large skillet over high heat.</li>
        <li>Take a golf ball-sized piece of dough and roll into a ball in your hands. Make a hole in the dough ball with your thumb; put a small amount of chicharron inside the hole, close it up, and flatten the ball with your hands into a thick tortilla shape. Place pupusa in the skillet and fry until golden brown(i think its better dark), about 2-3 minutes per side.</li>
      </ol>
