<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<h3>For the Filling:</h3>

<ul>

  <li>1/2 cup finely chopped bok choy leaves</li>
  <li>1/2 cup finely chopped napa cabbage</li>
  <li>1/4 cup finely chopped green onion</li>
  <li>1 Pound of Ground pork</li>
  <li>2 teaspoon of Soy sauce</li>
  <li>2 teaspoon 0f rice wine</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon sesame oil</li>
  <li>Dash of White pepper</li>


</ul>

<h3>For The Dumplings:</h3>


<ul>
 <li>1 pack of dumpling/gyoza wrappers (48-count)</li>
 <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch mixxed with 2 tablespoons cold water</li>
 <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil, more if needed</li>
 <li>1/3 cup of water, more if needed</li>
 <li>Dipping sauce, optional</li>

</ul>

<h2>Steps to Make Them</h2>

<h3>Make The Filling</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Gather the ingredients for the filling.</li>
  <li>In a large bowl, combine the filling ingredients. Use your fingers to mix everything together. If preparing the filling ahead of time, store in a sealed container in the refrigerator until ready to use.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Make the Dumplings</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Gather the rest of the ingredients.</li>
  <li>Place a dumpling wrapper on a cutting board. Cover the remaining wrappers with a damp cloth to keep them from drying out while filling and folding the dumplings. Add a heaping teaspoon of the filling to the middle of the pot sticker wrapper and use your finger to spread it out toward the sides. Be sure not to overfill or spread the filling too close to the edge of the wrapper. </li>
  <li>To fold the dumpling, moisten the edges of the wrapper with the mixture of water and cornstarch to make it easier to seal. Use the optional egg white instead if you'd prefer. </li>
  <li>Gently lift the edges of the moistened wrapper over the filling and bring it together at the top center. Crimp the edges of the wrapper several times along the edge and pinch together to seal. Repeat with the remaining wrappers and filling. Keep the dumplings covered lightly with plastic wrap or a slightly damp clean kitchen towel as you work to avoid drying out.</li>
  <li>Heat a wok or nonstick skillet over medium-high heat and add the oil. Add 10 to 12 pot stickers at a time and cook for 2 to 3 minutes until the bottoms are browned. </li>
  <li>Add 1/3 cup water, cover, and steam the dumplings until cooked through and the liquid is absorbed, about 5 minutes.</li>
  <li>Remove and cook the remaining dumplings in the same manner. Usually, 1/3 cup of water is enough to steam 10 to 12 dumplings, but use more if needed. </li>
  <li>Serve alone or with a <a href="https://www.thespruceeats.com/chinese-dumpling-dipping-sauce-p2-4118755">Dipping sauce</a>.</li>
